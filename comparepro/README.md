## Introduction
This project is a comparison web application that allows users to compare details of two (current capacity) products from different stores using the product links.
Product information is gotten using a dedicated API to the store and displayed as a product card. Details are compared side-by-side.

Current capability only provides comparison between Amazon products but future updates will include more capabilities.
